Code to human simulate calcium transient and myofilament contraction
This matlab program creates a plot of calcium transients and myofilament force production in human cardiomyocytes. It was created for a contribution to our study of the molecular changes in the ageing human heart (ref to be provided). 

To reproduce the results in Figure 6 of the paper, execute run_PS_Human.m and then execute plot_SERCA_MHC_results.m.
